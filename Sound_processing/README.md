# Sound Processing

This folder collects the audio manipulations we have tried and learned through in order to implement sound processing in our workflow. <br>

* The very useful UCL course on spectrogram data was consulted as documentation and is present as a pdf file here.
* Most documentation we have found focuses on the speech and music recodnition. Therefore, MEL spectrograms are used. 
These spectrograms are optimized to enhance the visualization of frequencies humans hear preferably. 
* In our case we focused on MagSpectrograms as they are referenced to be suited for the marine mammals' sounds.
